            Santa Susanna puts down its roots in the south of the Costa Brava. It’s got something for everyone, with its two kilometres of beaches, cobbled old town and rural surroundings. There’s plenty of history, too, including a string of 15th-century watchtowers which were built to protect the town from pirates. The Massif Montnegre national park, which is packed with cycling and hiking trails, is close by, as well.<br>
            
            <br><span style="font-weight: 700;"> Seafood and sundowners</span>
            When it comes to sunset, you’ve got a variety of options. In the town itself, you’re looking at leisurely evenings in one of the many restaurants on the palm-lined promenade – the eateries specialising in seafood come highly recommended. If you’re looking for something a little more lively, Malgrat’s a 10-minute taxi ride away. This town’s aptly named Bar Street has you covered for nights out.<br>
            
           <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">Multipack of beaches</span> 
            A chain of three beaches brackets Santa Susanna, and each has its own speciality. The Platja de les Dunes is best for watersports, while the Platja de Llevant’s a winner for families. The Platja de les Caletes is the place to go for a bit of peace and quiet as it’s made up of lots of small coves divided up by rocks. All this is backed by a promenade where, alongside bars and restaurants, you’ll find a craft market stocked with the wares of local artisans.</p>
